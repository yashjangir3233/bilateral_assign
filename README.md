to run this app simply do "npm create-react-app ." and then npm run 

also as these(mockaroo, jasonplaceholder) mock api doesn't support the update methods so i have just write down the format of how to do the put method 

other thing is that due to limited requests per day in mockaroo i am using jasonplaceholder but this has only 10 rows of data so the show more functionality can be seen but it is there totally working

and for easy use i have deployed the assignment

"https://bilateral-assign.vercel.app/"
